&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;A storm was brewing, dark clouds rising in the distance. Groups of mounted imperials rushed out of the city, scouts and soldiers to join the war efforts, to get information and deliver their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Sure you want to leave now?” Maro asked, sitting next to her on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The building had a good view, near the outermost wall. “They have to be able to deal with it themselves. I can’t be here all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The man stood up and stretched. “You could be. I was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I can’t do much good here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“You could defend the city, be a reason for people not to attack.” Maro said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She knew he was just fucking with her but replied seriously nonetheless. “Sulivhaan is at level two sixty eight. Dagon at two sixty one. They have the Hand and the Shadowguard behind them. I trust them not to fuck this up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Maybe…,” She added, “Maybe it’s the wrong decision. But if I stay now, I will stay the next time. I care about them, even a little about the city itself, the people living in it. Still, I won’t let it hold me back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He shrugged, “Your decision. I hope you’re ready to live with the consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Like you did?” She shot back and watched in amusement as he grasped his heart, acting as if a powerful spell had hit him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I was there. And I still failed. Perhaps it would have been smarter to focus on what I was good at.” He said and stood up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Killing monsters?” Ilea asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“No.” He winked at her, “Gambling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea pushed some air out of her nose, “I’m sure the leaders of Ravenhall will rise to the challenge. If anything, the city would hold under siege. One level three hundred human won’t change the tide of war. A level three (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">430683</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 348 Moving out</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/429890</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 348 Moving out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea woke up with warm sunlight on her face, sweat on her brow. She yawned and sat up slowly, still on her ashen sofa she had created the night before. &lt;em&gt;Still active.&lt;/em&gt; The ashen clone was there too but stood unmoving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Aki was circling the thing slowly, occasionally slashing at it with somewhat awkward movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Maro commented on the strikes, standing a couple meters away. “You’re not using all your legs as efficiently as you could.” He said and turned towards Ilea, “Oh look, you woke up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She rubbed her eyes and pushed both healing magic and meditation through herself. Aspect of Ash as well as Azarinth Awakening were still active, the two free skills constantly running. Her Armor of Ash sat on her back, in the form of a rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The fire was out, only ash remaining. Still, some heat came from the big circle. A tiny white fox was sleeping nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea deemed it cruel to wake the thing up, instead joining the others. “You can move pretty well already.” She said to Aki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Not as well as your ash even.” The dagger turned Guardian said. He made a noise that sounded a little like a sigh. “An improvement of course but this body can do so much more… I feel it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea chuckled and smiled at him, dissolving her ashen clone, “I think you’ll soon reach a normal Guardian’s capabilities. It will be interesting to see how far you can push that thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“He’s still just level two hundred.” Maro said, shaking his head, “And I don’t think he can level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I know monsters don’t usually but some Taleen machines were a little higher than others. Demons can level too and they only have one class. What do you think?” Ilea commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Maro walked up to Aki and touched one of the sword (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">429890</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 18:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 347 Steel and Ash</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/429527</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 347 Steel and Ash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Should we go outside?” Maro asked, “Stuff here will get wrecked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea grew her ashen limbs and held down each leg and sword individually. &lt;em&gt;No hands. At least he can be the most efficient cake cutter. &lt;/em&gt;“Aki? Did you calm down. Are you there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I feel… restricted.” Aki replied, “Did I lose it all again… I cannot see anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“That’s because I’m holding you down and your insect machine face is facing the wall. Try to turn your head first.” Ilea said and chuckled. “Seems like it actually worked. Now this baby dagger just has to learn how to walk.” She commented and identified him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Guardian of Akelion – lvl 200]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Oh.” Aki said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea rolled her eyes, “That’s your left most arm that you’re moving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Maro laughed from the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Don’t laugh you fuck!” Aki exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;That only made the necromancer laugh more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea stepped aside, her ashen limbs doing all the work. “Just keep figuring things out. Can you get my hammer, Iana?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“What’s… what’s his level?” The enchantress asked, summoning the hammer out of her new storage ring, the thing falling down onto the table with a dull sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Two hundred.” Maro replied, “I think he’s categorized as a monster. Hey… Aki right? Think of a status. Do you have one?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I’ll give you a fucking status.” The dagger, now Guardian replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea chuckled. “Like my very own child.” She grabbed the hammer and moved it around, “How do I activate it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Check here.” Iana said, tapping the hammer as she kept her gaze on the Guardian and the blades sometimes trying to move. “Try to connect your mana, let it flow inside (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">429527</guid><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2019 18:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 346 The Necromancer</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/429112</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 346 The Necromancer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea was led into the complex, a balcony overlooking five floors lit in various colors, both torches and magical light present. On the ground floor a red hue was prominent, the smells of smoke, sex and blood were prevalent. Puke and alcohol too. “Lovely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The guard next to her grunted, “Lovely that we have to fix the door. Again.” He shook his head and walked off, “Joe! Get your ass out here, the door is busted again!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea heard a distant cursing. She chuckled at that. &lt;em&gt;Maybe if &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fuck off wasn’t the first thing they said &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;to people &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;trying to get in, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;it would &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;make &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; circumstances a little less &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;numerous. &lt;/em&gt;She spotted Maro instantly, the man standing near a roulette table with a following. His armor stood out amongst the scantily clothed bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She jumped over the railing and fell down, blinking right before she landed to soften the fall. Few even noticed her, most of them in a daze or focused on the dancers moving around the various platforms and stages. Ilea admitted she stole more than a glance too, yet still making her way to the gambling necromancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Black, black, black, black.” She heard him as well as the crowd murmur, the little marble finally coming to a stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;People parted for her and a moment later, she was standing next to Maro. “Shame.” She said, “Should have bet on red.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The man laughed, welcoming her with a tight hug, “My friend! It is no shame, winning and losing is part of the game! And black is the color of death, there was no choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She smiled, “Been enjoying yourself?” She asked, “I hear you organized an orgy and lost a ton of gold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He moved his hand around her back, “Ah, that small party?” (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">429112</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2019 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 345 Corpses</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/428714</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 345 Corpses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Noon had already come and gone. The sky above Ravenhall was clear, only a couple clouds visible in the distance as Ilea walked towards the City Hall. A grand building, towering over its neighbors. Straight gray stone decorated with designs only magic allowed, or perhaps thousands of hours of chiseling. Pillars adorned and stabilized the front of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea certainly felt like she was walking into the highest court of the city. &lt;em&gt;How much of this did they have to rebuild. &lt;/em&gt;She wondered, hardly any noticeable renovation or repair work visible. Magic of course allowed for more nuanced restoration than what she had seen on Earth. &lt;em&gt;The people &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;building their cathedrals would &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;go nuts &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;seeing the possibilities here. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their lifetime works &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;created in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;weeks or months thanks to capable &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;stone mages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;As she walked into the building, a guard stopped her at the door. Ilea moved her ash armor over herself, mostly to keep her face hidden amongst the nobles. If they really wanted to find out who she was, there were enough sources in the city by now but she could at least make it a little harder to find out. “I’m Lilith, here to see the Nobility Mediator.” She said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The guard chuckled, “Of course, and I am the king of Ravenhall.” He paused, “Only nobles are allowed in and with that armor and your healer tag, I think you’re a member of the Hand or just an adventurer. If you’re on the list, do state your name.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea walked closer and reached out to the man, really not in the mood for any more of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Warrior – lvl 75]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;His short broadsword flashed out and stopped dead on her hand, his eyes going wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Trian appeared between them, one hand (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">428714</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2019 18:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 344 Influence of the Rich</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/428363</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 344 Influence of the Rich&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“This is another one from you!” Cless exclaimed, pointing at one of the paintings. One of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Claire was working on her desk, a small enchantment active to blend out the talk between Cless and Ilea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“It’s beautiful. Do I really look that cool?” Ilea asked, crouching down to see the painting better. It was her, fighting a Blue Reaper, blood and ash divided by a streak of blue lightning. Drawn with what looked like oil. She had seen Cless draw before and knew that there was no oil involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magical oil creator? &lt;/em&gt;She mused, “And this one is from Ravenhall?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She pointed at a bigger painting, the destroyed middle section of the back then only wall. The massive demonic monster flying above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wonder what they did with the corpse and all the bones. &lt;/em&gt;“And these are Kyrian.” Ilea said, the man’s armor apparently changing to a more sleek design, less protrusions and spikes but thicker. More sturdy. The beasts he was fighting in the pictures ranged from Taleen Guardians to Spirits of Winter to unknown canine monsters. The painting Cless had finished just the week prior showed him in some sort of castle ruin, the man flying and surrounded by cold winds and snow as he looked down onto the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea tried to memorize as much of the surroundings as possible. “And how’s school going?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The girl rolled her eyes, “They don’t call it school here, Ilea. This isn’t England.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Well, how are your studies going then.” Ilea humored her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“It’s going well. I’m learning about a variety of monsters living in the wild, magic and magic theory. I don’t understand some of the words but William says I’m smarter than half the class.” She said and smiled to herself, looking to the (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">428363</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2019 18:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 343 A Breath of Air</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/428023</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 343 A Breath of Air&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea started with the crates of loot she had gotten in the Vineyard caves, the collection of the Undying Lord moving on to her. &lt;em&gt;I wonder if in ten thousand years someone will invade my home to kill my skeletal undead remains, taking all my stuff and moving it somewhere else. &lt;/em&gt;She laughed at the thought, already excited for the fight. &lt;em&gt;I would probably not be around anyway, looking for something exciting out there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;There were lots of weapons and armors. Ilea had designated the room she was in as the armory and decided to put any not fighting related treasures further down, into the part of the house that was a little more secret. With all the skills people had for finding hidden spaces, she assumed a high level scavenger or rogue wouldn’t have an issue getting it anyway. Luckily, she had sorted the loot already back in the bone mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;It took her twenty minutes to fill all the gear onto the hooks, brackets, as well as weapon and armor racks. Her ashen limbs helped tremendously, a certain uncaring attitude required to ignore some of the scratches and rough handling of the beautifully crafted and doubtlessly expensive weapons. Ilea had the opinion that if anything got damaged because of that, it wasn’t really worth keeping anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;When she was done, Ilea smiled and crossed her arms, nodding at the sight. The magical lights illuminating the room beautifully reflected off the various metals, a colorful palette of displayed wealth and power. She had no idea what most of the weapons were even called, even dubious on how to use some of them. The only thing she could surmise was that a varied horde of warriors tried to kill the Undying Lord. &lt;em&gt;Or he went out and hunted them down. &lt;/em&gt;His skull had sadly been molded into her helmet, otherwise she would have (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">428023</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2019 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 342 Are you not entertained?</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/427148</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 342 Are you not entertained?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Well, Mr. Grom, do you have any proof or eye witnesses to testify against this woman?” Jacquen asked, forcing himself to look at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He noticed his colleague had taken a couple steps back, letting him take the lead. &lt;em&gt;Abandoned as always. &lt;/em&gt;Then again, for the level sixty warrior, everybody here was likely terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Proof? My word? I’m a noble, that should be enough. Or am I misremembering imperial law?” The man said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Jacquen rolled his eyes, &lt;em&gt;How long exactly have you lived here? &lt;/em&gt;“A noble of your influence must know about the contracts forged after the demonic catastrophe. Without proof, even the empress herself could not convict someone of a crime, not in Ravenhall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The noble ground his teeth and looked his way with an annoyed expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Very much aware of the contracts, as I had suspected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The healer spoke up then, “I don’t know about the laws but we could end this quickly. He can hit me ten times, with whatever he can do. Afterwards I hit him just once, to make it fair. I suppose that could alleviate his anger?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank the gods. &lt;/em&gt;Jacquen thought, “A challenge was raised Mr. Grom. The guard may be witness to its execution should you wish to accept.” &lt;em&gt;Come on you arrogant fool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The noble laughed, “A healer? Challenging me? Of course I accept. You will rue the day when you offended and attacked Villibald Grom, sage of fire and bearer of the Grom secret skills! I shall show you why they call me the devourer. Now prepare.” Fire came alive around the man, surging in power as his mana permeated the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Jacquen looked at both of them before he stepped a little to the side, &lt;em&gt;She offered him ten strikes. &lt;/em&gt;He watched (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">427148</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2019 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 341 Maximum Overbusiness</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/426745</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 341 Maximum Overbusiness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Should I do it in Ravenhall?” Iana asked after noting down some measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“No, I think Claire can get you when she comes to talk to Balduur. I’ll inform her. When do you think you’re done? I think it would also be good to bring all this stuff.” Ilea said, gesturing widely around her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The enchantress looked around, “That… will be a little longer then. Just getting it up. Most of it was built to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea thought on it and summoned the Band of Infinity. “I think this should solve the problem. Consider it a gift, to make sure your work is the best it can be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The girl stared at the storage ring, back at Ilea and then once again at the ring. “I can’t…,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea stopped her immediately, grabbing her hand with a quick but gentle motion before she put the ring on, its size automatically changing to fit Iana’s finger. “Oh wow, you just could. Great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Balduur laughed and shook his head, heading for his own space in the smithy, “I’ll see you around then, Ilea. Do send your friend over.” He said, leaving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She gave him a nod and patted the speechless girl on her back, “Come on, you’ve got work to do. Maybe you’ll figure out how to mass produce these as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Iana looked at her, “Three days… I need three days for the armor and to pack everything up. With this. If it’s really alright. They’re exceptionally rare, random magical proportions evolved over centuries, I don’t think I could replicate it…,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“We’ll see, Iana.” Ilea commented with a smirk, “I’ll be back in a couple days then. Have fun you two.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Don’t forget to check for a taleen machine!” Aki said from the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea waved him off, “Yea, yea. If we don’t have anything, I’ll get (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">426745</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 340 Craftswoman</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/426410</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 340 Craftswoman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One silver. They really don’t want outsiders in here. &lt;/em&gt;She thought, walking towards the big house of the smith. Her bone boots left behind deep tracks in the snow, the crunching sound overshadowed by the chickens and pigs in the nearby pen. She wondered if they weren’t too cold but looking through her sphere, she realized there was more than one enchantment placed on the area. &lt;em&gt;Iana doing her due? &lt;/em&gt;She wondered, not sure if normal villages could afford or provide something like that. Remembering barns in more than one place she had visited spoke against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The sturdy door shook, Ilea’s fist pounding against it thrice. She heard grumbling from within, curses uttered in a deep and heavy voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The door swung open and Balduur was greeted with a chuckling Ilea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Hi Balduur.” She said, “Still angry at every visitor?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He grumbled and shook his head, “Girl. I didn’t expect you today. You’re still alive?” The question at least sounded sincere, as if he was glad to see her among the living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Smith – lvl 183]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Hey, you leveled again.” She said, stepping closer and shaking his hand, her strength overwhelming him without effort. “Not as much as I did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He chuckled, the sound like a deep rumble, “It seems you are right.” The man eyed her armor, moving a hand through his beard, “You found that? No… it’s too well fitting. A smith then.” He shook his head in disapproval, “I did not expect you to cheat on me, Ilea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She smiled, the armor vanishing into her necklace, “I just don’t want to travel every time I need something done. Not that I really need armor anymore.” She said, “May I come in?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He stepped aside and waved her inside, “Of course, I understand. (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">426410</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:00:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>`

&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“You gave up high leveled classes to take other ones?” Ilea asked. “You lose the level in that case, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“You do.” Feyrair confirmed. “And I have. Perhaps I was foolish and proud. My decisions however are my own and they have led me to what I am on this day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I’m sure you’re going to be nuts after hitting three hundred.” Ilea commented. “I know a couple high level dungeons up north, you could get there in no time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Feyrair smiled at her. “May we start?” He asked and extended a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea moved back her ashen armor near her stomach and stored her bone armor. She summoned the gear once more and touched it with her ashen limbs. It wouldn’t regenerate in her storage item, she assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Go for it.” She said, both Feyrair and Maro releasing their spells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea healed herself and the elf, magic burning and decaying chunks of their unprotected bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The elf had revealed his left arm, the piece of scale armor previously protecting it had vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I know plenty of dungeons myself. Our quest however is not one of personal growth but far beyond such goals. In time, I will reach level three hundred and beyond. A steady pace that will allow high skill levels even in the third tier as well as achievements unlikely to show themselves in mere years or decades.” Feyrair explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea didn’t see it. Leveling to the next evolution would give him a significant increase instantly. He was going the long route it seemed, the very long route. Even taking new classes entirely and losing whatever progression he had before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She assumed he hadn’t been any lower than two hundred. &lt;em&gt;Still possible in a couple years. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;He can’t be as reckless &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;without a healer (...)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">440278</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 372 Contact</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/439628</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 372 Contact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea led Walter through the tunnels, the markings on the walls leading her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Maro had sneaked in behind them, avoiding the guards that were still very much busy with dismantling traps and searching through already looted rooms and halls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;They would find some things left behind by her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“We could have gotten the others too.” Ilea said, glancing towards Walter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I trust you Ilea, it scares me but I do. And still, I won’t let Lucia and the others just meet a bunch of elves. They were our enemy for hundreds of years, as long as I can remember. Always a looming threat and never did they step up to try and talk.” He dismissed the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“To be fair, you don’t know if they never did. Who in their right mind would try and side with elves?” Maro asked and twirled his finger near his temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Smugglers, apparently.” Ilea replied, looking at him as she shrugged and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Or you, a fighting obsessed mad woman who released a thousand year old necromancer from his prison and crypt.” Maro said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“You two are stressing me out.” Walter said. “It was enough of a thrill to be involved in the mission earlier. This is magnitudes beyond. We are about to meet elves.” He said the last sentence in a quieter tone, as if surprised by it himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“We are.” Ilea said. “And I need to get some resistance training in too. They have insane magic power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Walter stopped suddenly. “If Riverwatch find out about this, we’re done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I’m still somewhere around. Probably.” Maro said. “Let them try.” He smirked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea turned around. “I’ll write a letter, signed with my mana signature. Addressed to Alistair. And I will inform Claire of course. I don’t want her to organize (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">439628</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 371 Potential Allies</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/439266</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 371 Potential Allies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea finished eating too, exchanging some stories about the north with them. She decided not to mention Elfie and his crew yet, not before she talked to them about this new group of Cerithil Hunters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She sat back and smiled, crossing her arms. “So, you’re a dragon or what was that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The elf laughed, showing his sharp teeth now that he wasn’t wearing his helmet anymore. “Perhaps one day… one day I’ll be one of them.” He looked up with longing red eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ben laughed. “Keep dreaming. Shapeshifting is all you’ll ever get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Possibilities are unlimited.” Isalthar commented, drinking from a beautiful white porcelain cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea thought it was tea, the smell at least reminded her of herbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“We’re talking about dragons.” Ben said, rolling his eyes. “There are limits. He’s a fighter, he’s not going to be as old as you are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I sadly have to agree there.” Feyrair sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“So you’re shapeshifting into one? How did you get the class?” Ilea asked with interest. “Did you meet one? Fight one?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Feyrair laughed. “That, dear human, is not something I would tell to someone who couldn’t defeat me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I defeated you though.” Ilea said, squinting her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Who couldn’t defeat me at least twice.” The elf changed the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“You’re going to raise that once I slap you around again, aren’t you.” She commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“He is.” Ben said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I’ll go check with my associates then but if you’re staying for a while, I’d love to train some resistances and have more bouts. I think it’d be beneficial for all of us.” Ilea said and got up. Her Heat Resistance hadn’t leveled in a while and just a couple attacks from Feyrair (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">439266</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2019 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 370 Red Scales</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/438887</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 370 Red Scales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea’s buffs flared up and she met him with her full arsenal. Ashen limbs smashed into his armor before he reached her, glancing off the hard scales. Heart of Cinder started burning in her core as she felt the heat of his white flames bite into her ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She dodged to the side as the elf slid to a stop and appeared before her, his claws slashing at her with a blazing white edge, several centimeters long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea knew he would penetrate her ash halfway but not further. She let him hit and slammed her fist into his stomach, absolute destruction and storm of cinders pushing their mana into his scales and body, a big chunk of the energy blocked by his armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;His claws penetrated, suddenly expanding and cutting through all her ash before they scratched along her bone armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She ducked under his other arm and grabbed his leg, twirling around before she slammed his form into the stone with all the might she could muster. Rock cracked and shattered as his massive weight crashed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The elf was unfazed by the blow, getting up when sixteen ashen limbs slashed into him, each delivering Storm of Cinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He ripped his leg free of her hold and vanished, appearing a couple meters away in a crouch. His eyes narrowed before heat gathered in front of his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea felt it form the distance and waited. Azarinth Fighting told her of his powerful attack, likely fire that would burn through her ash. &lt;em&gt;He’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;insane for his level. &lt;/em&gt;She thought and watched the white flame form, small at first but expanding in an explosive wave as if a dam was opened in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She blinked in the last moment, appearing thirty meters to the side. Her eyes opened wide as she watched the cone of fire arch towards her, the other (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">438887</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2019 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 369 Cursed Meeting</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/438566</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 369 Cursed Meeting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Pan had apparently not noticed any of the commotion. She was brushing her luscious hair in front of a mirror, her room huge and spacious. A hugebed and various expensive pieces of furniture surrounding it, coupled with warm light from magical lights embedded into the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She turned her head when the door opened, looking at the dark Shadow clad in ashen armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“What is the meaning of this?” She asked, her voice confident, annoyed even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She took a step towards Ilea, recognition flickering in her eyes. “You are Lilith. Come to learn about our order, have you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea dragged in Mauro. “I’ve come to make sure you don’t get away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Get away?” Pan glanced at Mauro and back to Ilea, taking a step back. “I’m with the Corinth order… you wouldn’t want to offend us. Do I have to remind you who I represent?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea stepped closer. “I know exactly who you represent. You represent an order that is happy to support slavers. I don’t recall slavery being legal in Dawntree or am I missing something?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Don’t throw me in with these savages. I was hired to heal, nothing else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Nothing else?” Ilea asked. “Mauro… what did you tell me before? About her help?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Pan’s eyes widened before she glared at Mauro with an angry look. “You dog. Barking whenever someone asks you to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Do you deny it then?” Ilea asked. “To have helped in torturing city guards?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Pan sighed. “I only did my job. What I was asked to do. If it’s anybody’s fault, it’s theirs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does she not even recognize what she did? &lt;/em&gt;Ilea was baffled. “A proud member of the Corinth order, taking orders from… what did you call him, a dog?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I merely healed them. (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">438566</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 368 Blissful Edge</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/438283</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 368 Blissful Edge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Mauro woke up with a massive headache. &lt;em&gt;What the fuck happened? &lt;/em&gt;He felt like he was mauled by three bears, healed back to health and mauled again. It felt like he was floating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ash… I feel… ash. &lt;/em&gt;He remembered then. Lilith, she was the Shadow. His eyes opened wide as he turned his head and looked around. They were still in the tunnels of their hideout and he was being, carried?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He looked down on his own body and saw the thick ashen ropes around him. &lt;em&gt;Limbs? &lt;/em&gt;He asked himself as he followed them, finding their origin to be none other than Lilith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;She was walking in silence, glancing his way when she realized he was awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;No words were spoken, neither by him nor her. The situation was clear. He had lost and would face the guard. &lt;em&gt;She didn’t kill me yet. Did I injure her? &lt;/em&gt;He had activated all his skills, had pushed himself further than he ever had. No memory remained from what happened after but he knew he had tasted blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe she realized I’m of more use alive. Or…, &lt;/em&gt;He stopped himself from smirking, the thought flashing through his mind. There was a chance but first he would wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Mauro could bide his time, he knew how to talk, if anything and he knew there were things she wanted. His storage ring was gone of course but she had no access to it, not until he was dead or gave her access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Waiting for his ownership to fade was likely not an option for the impulsive woman. He heard steps, dozens of people walking through the corridor, led by himself and Lilith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Zair was there too, looking his way with a frightful expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That rat. I knew it. &lt;/em&gt;Mauro wasn’t too surprised or annoyed about it. If cooperation had secured his (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">438283</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 367 Deal with the Devil</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/437942</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 367 Deal with the Devil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“It’s been an hour.” Kevan said casually, taking a sip from his tea. “Also, we’re being watched.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I’m well aware of that.” Dale replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He had a lot of trust in Ilea but maybe she had bitten off too much this time. &lt;em&gt;What would I be able to do &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;if she really did?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I could help, you know?” Kevan said, his cup of tea placed back on the small plate. The man leaned back and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dale couldn’t help but chuckle. “No offense but I don’t think you’re in the same league as she is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“You’re right. Yet I am the one here. At the very least I could get you out of there if things get dangerous.” Kevan said and looked towards the warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dale wasn’t sure. “Why should I trust you? I could get a squad together and force my way in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Kevan turned his way. “That is a risky move. With the little information we have. You wouldn’t risk your men for that. Yourself however, I believe you would risk that. For her… for those still missing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I would.” Dale admitted. Despite the danger, despite his own family. He couldn’t get Vin’s face out of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“As for my reasons. I’m bored. That mad healer damn near killed me and now she forced me on this fool’s errand. I want to go home and lie down.” Kevan sighed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dale believed him. He had seen and talked to his fair share of people. Kevan wasn’t a liar. “We go and ask to speak to the owner. Find out more. You help me get out if they are stupid enough to attack.” They could buy Ilea some time with a distraction. If she really was in danger, they might be able to prevent her death with the leverage of the guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Kevan rejoiced and stood up. “Finally.” He dusted off his robe and disappeared in a (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">437942</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 13:20:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 366 The Gray Company</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/437324</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 366 The Gray Company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Somebody is here.” The new mage said, suddenly wide awake. His eyebrows quirked up, an expression of surprise on his face. “They’re moving… quick. Arcane teleportation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Mauro sighed and put down his pen. The contracts would have to wait. If an intruder got out and informed the guard, he would lose quite a lot more time than this. Even being behind. “Who’s coming now? I thought we would have paid off everyone interested by now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Come on guys, flush out and incapacitate. Hit to kill if he turns out to be dangerous.” He said and grabbed his backpack full of ash, a shroud of dark gray forming on top of his armor at the same time. “Zair, was it? You come with us. Show us where the intruder is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The mage looked at him with his one working eye, moving a towel to his other one. He dabbed it lightly to get the moisture away, wincing at the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Half the mage’s face had been burnt, leaving him in this sorry state. Mauro had considered not hiring the man because of his hideous appearance. Distracting. He couldn’t afford to ignore someone as useful as him however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;His men got ready, putting on missing armor pieces and preparing their weapons. Maces, swords, bows as well as daggers and even that weird one with a whip. All present, all above level one hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;If Alistair had hired a Shadow Squadlike Nolan had suggested, they had to be ready. Taking out their scout would be the top priority. After that it was simply a matter of cleaning up, finding and taking care of those that had talked and making sure the city didn’t have a reason to hire another squad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“What do you think? Another one of them officers?” One of the men asked, slurring his words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Are you drunk?” Mauro asked. “Pan, get your ass over here (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">437324</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2019 16:00:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 365 Captain of the Guard</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/437059</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 365 Captain of the Guard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Come in.” Dale’s voice had a defeated undertone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“It’s me.” Ilea said, her head peeking into the door she slightly opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I know it’s you.” Dale said. “Anybody else has appointments or uses the gates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Really?” Ilea asked as she stepped inside. “I’m here with two guys, can they come in?” She looked around the small office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;A stack of papers were on his small wooden desk. His chair had seen better days. A small magical light provided some illumination. A bunch of file cabinets were put up on each wall, interspersed by book shelves as well as a small weapon rack. There was no carpet, just plain old wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Damn, I didn’t remember this place to be so bleak.” Ilea chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“You can come in, your friends too.” Dale said, putting away the stacks. “Your help made the evaluation finish early.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea knocked on the door behind her. “Come on in.” She said and walked to the desk, sitting down on the second chair opposite the man. “So you have time?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dale sighed before he smiled. “Of course. I did hope to get to some other things I’ve been postponing for weeks but I suppose for you, I always have time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Great.” Ilea said. “This is Walter and Kevan. They’re helping me with the third Shadow job Alistair put out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Welcome.” Dale nodded to the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Kevan nodded and Walter smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Nice to meet you, captain.” Walter said respectfully, giving him a nod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea spent the next five minutes explaining what the mission was about and what they had already done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“That is very weird.” Dale confirmed. “Many of the investigators as well as some (...)&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">437059</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2019 16:00:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Azarinth Healer - Chapter 364 Detective Smash</title><link>https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/chapter/436748</link><description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;Chapter 364 Detective Smash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea gave Trevor a glance when she was done looking through his headquarters. There had been some hidden areas she discovered but nothing other than more likely stolen goods came up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Happy?” He asked, stepping up behind her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Yea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He snorted. “I wouldn’t have taken you for such a lawful citizen. I know you Shadows do your fair share of shady shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ilea nodded. “I have probably killed more people than you have, many of them for worse reasons too. Morally speaking of course.” She said and shrugged. “I recommended you to Dale, just feel a little personal responsibility when it comes to you.” She smirked and jabbed his arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Fucking hypocrite.” He whispered, glancing at her to see if she heard. “I have lines I won’t cross, Ilea. And that will stay that way.” He said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“I was looking for slaves or torture, not the fact that you killed people.” Ilea said. “Don’t whisper around people like me. We can probably hear you. Or in my case, even feel your… distress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;He sighed before he chuckled. “Noted. Way to make Shadows even more terrifying than they already were.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m not exactly any random Shadow. &lt;/em&gt;Ilea thought but kept that to herself. If the deterrent of having a Shadow look for you can prevent people from becoming criminals, half the work was already done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;“Well then, keep up the honest crime my dear Riversong leader. Perhaps we will meet again.” She smiled under her bone and ash.&lt;/p&gt;
